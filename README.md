## Live URL
<http://p2.jonnymoon.com>

## Description
This website allows users to generate random passwords. The passwords can be customized to include numbers, symbols, number of words, etc. The password generator is inspired by the xkcd comic <http://xkcd.com/936/>.

## Demo

## Details for teaching team
The website is responsive. I added extra options for setting the delimiter and controlling the casing of the words. I decided to use a list of the most common 5000 words so that it would be easier for people to remember the passwords.
